## About

This is the core module for [Eclipse](https://github.com/DataLinx/eclipsephp-app), a PHP app built with Filament and the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/).

It's an opinionated package, containing all the core resources and other code, including our selection of Filament plugins as dependencies. It's included in all our Eclipse projects and it's purpose is to have as much code as possible, thus keeping the skeleton/app package as slim as possible to make maintenance of apps easy.

## Requirements
