# Introduction

## System requirements

### Server
* PHP >= 8.3
    * See the `require` section in [composer.json](../composer.json) for any required PHP extensions
* MariaDB >= 10.11 
* Composer
* Node.js and npm

### Development
Although not obligatory, [Lando](https://lando.dev/) is recommended for setting up the Docker containers. All Eclipse packages already ship with a Lando config file.

If you create the project via `git clone`, there are no additional requirements.

However, if you want to create a new project via composer (recommended), you need to have on your system:
* PHP >= 8.3
* Composer

All other system requirements are automatically included by the Lando instance.
Node.js and npm are provided in the lando container.

## Getting started
1. Create a new project with composer:
    ```shell
    composer create-project eclipsephp/app myprojectname -s dev
    ````
2. Set the app URL to your desired URL
    * `APP_URL` in `.env`
    * `name` property in `.lando.dist.yml` (just the subdomain part)
    * Also fix proxy URLs in `.lando.dist.yml`
3. Build and start the app instance
    ```shell
    lando start
    ```` 

That's it! Open the provided link and the public page should be shown. Add `/admin` to the URL to see the admin panel. The database is already migrated and seeded and the test logins have already been set.

By doing these few steps you now have a functional Filament app with our Eclipse core package.

# Plugin development
Unfortunately, plugin development is not yet fully self-contained, meaning you need the app skeleton, where you will add the plugin you want to develop as a dependency that is symlinked from a local folder.  
However, this is needed only if you want to manually test the plugin in the app (in your browser), since running the tests uses a default Testbench Laravel skeleton.

üî∂ **Please note**: the core package is in fact not a Filament plugin, but nevertheless everything for plugin development also applies for core development.  

## Setting up
1. Follow the above [Getting started](Documentation.md#getting-started) section to set up an app skeleton.
2. Then, `git clone` the plugin you want to work on to a local folder inside the app, e.g. `packages/my-package`.
3. Add the local folder as a repository in the app's `composer.json`, e.g.:
    ```
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "./packages/my-package"
        }
    ]
    ```
4. Run `composer update` to create the symlink.

## Running tests
You can run the tests inside the package with
```shell
  lando test
```
... or within the container:
```shell
  composer test
```
This is just a proxy to the testbench `package:test` command.

üî∂ If you are developing the Core package, you must publish the Eclipse-provided config files before you can run tests.
```shell
  lando testbench vendor:publish --tag=eclipse-config
```
The reason for this is that these config files include other vendor configs that are already pre-configured the way we want them to be (i.e. multi-tenancy). All other plugins do not have this requirement ‚Äî they must be built to fit any configuration.

## Debugging

### Laravel Telescope
Telescope is already installed with the core package and ready to use in the development environment.
To enable it, just set the `TELESCOPE_ENABLED` variable in your `.env` file to `true` and visit the `/telescope` URL or click the _Tools > Telescope_ link in the panel navigation.

To use the dark theme also set the `TELESCOPE_DARK_THEME`.

# Core concepts

The following section explains the core concepts and applies to both app and plugin development.

## Users

### Authorization
For user authorization purposes, we use the [spatie/laravel-permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6) package and the [Filament Shield plugin](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/bezhansalleh-shield).

This setup does not change any core [Laravel authorization](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/authorization) principles, but it expands and makes it work in Filament.

There are two important points of integration:

1. **Defining what permissions make sense for a Filament resource.** This is done by setting custom permissions prefixes in the resource. Read more [here](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/bezhansalleh-shield#custom-permissions), but this is the gist of it:

    ```php
    <?php

    namespace Eclipse\Core\Filament\Resources;
     
    use BezhanSalleh\FilamentShield\Contracts\HasShieldPermissions;
    ...
     
    class LocaleResource extends Resource implements HasShieldPermissions
    {
        ...
     
        public static function getPermissionPrefixes(): array
        {
            return [
                'view_any',
                'create',
                'update',
                'delete',
                'delete_any',
            ];
        }
     
        ...
    }
    ```
2. **Generating model policies and permission database records.** You can do this for a single resource by running Shield's command:
    
    ```shell
   php artisan shield:generate --panel=admin --resource=LocaleResource
   ```
   This creates a policy class in your app policies directory, so if developing a plugin, you must move it to your plugin's policies directory.

With this done, Filament will automatically use the model policies for access authorization, as described in the [Filament docs](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/panels/resources/getting-started#authorization), while you can also use all the standard [Laravel authorization methods](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/authorization#authorizing-actions-using-policies), such as `$user->can('update', $locale)` etc.
